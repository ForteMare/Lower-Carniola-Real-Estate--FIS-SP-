It may be necessary to hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) the page for it to load accordingly. Sometimes the CSS somehow doesn't fully load.

### Site Mechanics

- The website works only with core technologies, vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. No Bootstrap or jQuery were used.

- Real estate content is served with PHP from an SQL database. Content is automatically generated on two pages and sub-content is accessed through string queries.

### TODO

- Fix page footer.

- Add contact page.

- Add page content.

#### **CSS Structure**

[1] Font
[2] Layout
[3] Design
[4] Behavior
